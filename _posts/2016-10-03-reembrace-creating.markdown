It's time we all re-embraced the act of creating. It’s why the majority of us are where we are. We grew up creating, solving problems in the way of games and puzzles. Somewhere along the way, and we have all been guilty of this, we revert to a more traditional constrained style of thinking that doesn’t allow us to create. We do too much exploitation of the things that exist in our current world view, and not enough exploration of what else is possible. This may have been possible 10 years ago but the speed t which technology is developed these days means that you're constantly under threat if you don't place yourself in a position where you can adapt and change to your environment.

As a business owner, it can be easy to fall into this trap with the every day pressures and deadlines it may feel like you don't have the lucury to explore or create. We deal exclusively with the impending, with what we currently have, with facts, numbers and figures. I believe this is something that is engrained over time as opposed to a natural trait. 

The very practice of creating, and creating often, gets one into the habit of thinking creatively and looking for solutions out with the ordinary or accepted. Creating can be anything, it’s not important, but its the habit of thinking and doing which

See the below video by Stef Lewandowski who’s mantra is “Create something every day”. 

> A rule:
I live by the rule “create something every day”, which means I’ve become good at hacking things together quickly using code and design. The term “hacker” was given to me because I’ve done so many little hack projects. The thing is, that one or two of them have turned into real live businesses…</blockquote>
Stef is primarily a techie but the mantra and principles are useful for anyone, especially engineers.

So what lessons can we draw from this video?

1. It doesn’t matter what you create, just create.

2. Engrain it in your routine. Get into the habit and you’ll no longer think of it as creating. It’s hard at the start, but the habit of creating becomes natural and engrained in your day to day.

3. There’s so many different ways you can create. Write. Speak. Add value to something.

4. Creativity can be developed - and you should actively seek to develop your creativity as an engineer. Creativity isn’t just about design, it’s about solving problems in an innovative way.

5. You should actively seek to develop a creative mindset as an engineer, it’ll help you design and engineer better solutions. It’ll allow you to tap into your ideas and thoughts more fully. You’ll be able to think about processes and ideas differently within your role. The benefits are multiple. 

We should never stop creating. If creating something every day seems like a stretch, then start by creating something every week. Actively pursue unusual solutions to everyday problems, if design isn’t your thing, think about the process and the way things are built. You’ll be surprised at some of the things you’ll discover when you start questioning things that have become accepted.

The minute a busienss stops creating and gets comfortable, this is when creativity begins to flounder and accepted solutions become commonplace. Lack of exploration, can be detrimental to your busines and is the enemy of your abilities to become a proactive and creative leader.
