  <p>A story takes all the senseless data that the world provides and turns it into something meaningful</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Stories spread faster than corporate copy-write or in your face marketing materials, they alleviate doubt and simplify even the complex into something uniquely relatable. Whatever your business does, in whatever function or level you should think about this and how it can make an impact in the way that you communicate your ideas.</p>

<p>Amongst our desire to solve problems for our customer we forget the stories that actually make our work meaningful and exciting. We’re too engrained in the numbers, the details, the charts, when often a simple story would be far more worthwhile. Our brains are able to cope with and retain narrative context in a far better way than facts and figures, and it’s time we used this to our advantage.</p>

<p>There’s a better way to present your solution, then throwing up as many facts and figures as possible on a powerpoint and hope for the best. Even if you’re read up on the art of presenting effectively, there’s still a chance you’re presentation is missing something without the use of a narrative to communicate your key points. This is even more prevalent when you consider the interactions that we have to make as business owners on a day to day basis. We are always telling stories to our coworkers and employees in an effort to persuade them or provide a solution or to seek change.</p>

<p>The truth is though, it’s hard. Really hard. Some subjects and settings just don’t lend themselves to amazing presentations, and powerful story telling. But it is possible, I assure you. It takes time though - time and careful thought - to develop your own story telling style. But it’s worthwhile, because stories create emotions that allow our ideas to stick and move forwards.</p>

<p>Good stories have the power to unify a team and create a common goal to strive for. Story telling can be made up of real experiences or a craft of narratives twisted around the facts. I’m not suggesting you should tell fairytales or lies to make your point exciting, but I’m suggesting drawing parallels and using common language and narrative to craft your solutions.</p>

<p>Story telling is just as basic as you when you were taught it in primary school. You use plot, characters, and turning point/surprise/ or dramatic twist of some sort. It’s not changed since then, the same principles apply, even in engineering. The only thing that changes is the context, the villain of your story could be that really complex problem you’ve been working tirelessly to overcome. Whilst working on this problem you undoubtedly had to make changes, and had to react to failures along the way. Maybe you found your solution in a surprising place? How did you find the solution, and how does it help you move forward? What’s the happy ending?</p>

<hr />

<p>So where do we start? From the beginning. Whats the purpose of your work? Think about the why of what you’re doing and make it relatable. You might have heard of the example about the man approaching bricklayers on the construction site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A man came upon a construction site where three people were working.  He asked the first, “What are you doing?” and the man replied: “I am laying bricks.” He asked the second, “What are you doing?” and the man replied: “I am building a wall.” As he approached the third, he heard him humming a tune as he worked, and asked, “What are you doing?” The man stood, looked up at the sky, and smiled, “I am building a cathedral!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That man, was doing exactly the same thing as his colleagues but he understood two things, the power of having a powerful greater purpose, and the power of story telling. What can we learn from our cathedral building friend?</p>

<ol>
  <li>He can see the big picture.</li>
  <li>He knows the why of what he is doing.</li>
  <li>How knows how what he is doing fits into his organisations goals.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>Lets build on this example and examine how even the seaminlgy complex can capture people’s attention:</p>

<p>(Note when describing this example, I build upon the following article describing how Elon pitches and what we can learn from it.)</p>

<p>In this pitch, Elon is essentially telling a story and there are two parts that hold the secret to why it is such an effective delivery: the traits and characteristics he displays; and the way in which he structures his narrative.</p>

<p>Delivering his Narrative</p>

<p>Let’s examine the way the traits in which he delivers his message. The important thing to note here is that we are discussing the way he comes across as opposed to critiquing his delivery.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He’s Passionate and Shows Emotion</li>
</ol>

<p>He’s absolutely fascinated and convinced by the story and the solution he is presenting. He’s massivley engrossed in everything that he is doing and this is pretty clear to the audience. It’s very hard to fake this, so we need convey a passion in what we do in order to tell stories well. We then need to share our passions with the audience and be able to convey our enthusiasm and excitement so that the audience can connect with you and share your passions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He Considers his Audience (How does this fit into my audiences goals?)</li>
</ol>

<p>Elon knows he’s pitching to people from a variety of backgrounds so he considerately avoids the use of Jargon. He estimated his audiences ability to understand the presentation and also what they were looking to gain from the story. He choose a framework that would resonate with them.  He couples this by knowing the most important points that he wants his audience to take away: these problems exist and we should care; Tesla are solving them; this is how tesla are solving them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He Uses Words Suitable for Non Tehnical People (Is this suitable for my audience?)</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one technical people are often guilty of - turning up to a client pitch and going into full flow about which CMS you prefer and why. Or perhaps turning up to a meeting with various departments and neglecting the backgrounds of the audience mebers entirely. Explaining things non technically does two things, it increases your knowledge of the subject and allows your audience to follow the story more readily.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He knows the subject (How does my solution aleviate the problem?)</li>
</ol>

<p>He has an in depth understanding of the subject that is clear but at no point does he overwhelm his audience with it. More on how Elon Achieves his in depth understanding of subjects . But the important thing here is that he knows the history, and the details of his subject matter. His audience have no doubts about his relative understanding of the matter.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He makes it about People (How can I stir emotion and create action)</li>
</ol>

<p>Stories are about people and so they must play an important role throughout. The solution that Musk presents is about people, a bettter world.</p>

<p>Structuring the Narrative</p>

<p>Now lets look at the way Elon structures his narrative. It’s well thought out and captures the attention of the audience.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He Presents the Big Picture First</li>
</ol>

<p>Just like our cathedral building friend, he presents the big picture. He avoids unnecessary detail and instead captivates the audience in his narrative by making an extremely complex issue seem imminintely solveable by breaking it down into manageable pieces.</p>

<ol>
  <li>He names the villian (Why we must take action)</li>
</ol>

<p>As in the stories we were told when we were younger, Elons narrative has a clear Villian who we absolutely must overcome. In the blog post linked above the writer says:</p>

<p>When Musk shows this image of burning fossil fuels, you can practically hear Darth Vader’s ominous breath.
3. He uses a pattern of tension and resolution (Stirring more emotion)</p>

<p>He builds anticipation throughout by first showing us that this extremely complex issue (the villian) is imminently solveable (defeatable) if we apply the correct resources, and if we act soon.</p>

<p>Before saying anything about batteries, Musk describes his version of happily-ever-after: a civilization powered by “this handy fusion reactor in the sky, called the Sun.” Showing the enemy’s defeat before explaining how you’ll make it happen can feel wrong for novice presenters — like blurting out the punchline before you’ve told a joke. But when an audience knows where you’re headed, they’re much more likely to buckle in for the ride.
4. He Tells Us About the Struggles</p>

<p>Having broke down the problem and made us feel it is imminintely soleable, he know tells us about the struggles and barriers to success.</p>

<p>Musk addresses three obstacles to a solar-powered world:
(i) The amount of energy produced by solar panels varies throughout the day and night (thus the need for batteries):
(ii) Most people think the land area required for batteries to store enough energy to rid U.S. of fossil fuels would be really huge (but according to Musk, it’s that tiny red dot in Texas):
(iii) Currently available batteries suck in seven specific ways
5. The Resolution (And How it Will it Defeat the Villian)</p>

<p>Having told us about the the big picture, the villian, the solution, and the struggles, he then presents the resolution to his story - The Powerwall. In another twist he provides evidence by revealing the Powerwall batteries are supplying the auditorium form which he is speaking.</p>

<p>So how can we create better stories?</p>

<p>We need to be more aware of the factors listed above, but also to begin to conciously examine our experiences in search of effective narratives that will convey our message better. People reosnate with experienes and emotions and so this is absolutely critical to story telling. Think of your friends or colleagues who are the most jovial and best story tellers you know, it’s often the way that they convey the emotion that sets their stories apart. Not the content itself. So we need find the events in our lives that have shaped the ideas we are conveying. These anecdotes are an integral part of conveying our message and beginning to appreicate them and consider them as either a tool when we protray our ideas or as the emodyment of the idea in itself.</p>

<p>So to begin story telling more effectively, We need to start mining your personal experiencess for stories that support your ideas and begin dripping them into the way you present your solutions.</p>
