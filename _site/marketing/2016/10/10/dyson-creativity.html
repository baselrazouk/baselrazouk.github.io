  <div class="content">
      <p>In his latest, hugely insightful book, Mathew Syed investigates the role of failure in success, and why some people are able to recognise and learn from their mistakes whilst discussing the cognitive biases that stop others from doing the same.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this book, it’s not a typical ‘we should fail really often’ narrative you’ve probably heard often, but rather an in depth insightful look at the culture and attitudes towards failure in industries and individuals. It’s well researched and well written. The main contrast that runs through the entirety of the book is the subtle but impactful differences between the aviation industry and the medical industry, and why the aviation industry is a pioneering one when it comes to embracing and learning from failure.</p>

<p>For me, one of the most insightful pieces in the book, was an interview conducted by Mathew with James Dyson. James is truly a pioneer, his foundation is dedicated to “enouraging young people to think different, make mistakes, invent and realise their engienering potential”. Most people know him as the guy who owns Dyson who make hoovers and hand dryers; but very few know the story behind his innovations and success. It’s safe to say he is a true innovator.</p>

<p>He has been championing the role of creativity in Engineering for many years now and in this book he breaks it down for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People think of creativity as a mystical process. The idea is that creative insights emerge from the ether through pure contemplation. This model conceives of innovation as something that happens to people, normally geniuses. But this could not be more wrong. Creativity is something that has to be worked at, and it has specific characteristics. Unless we understand how it happens, we will not improve our creativity, as a society or as a world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how does creativity happen and how can we be more creative? Mathew goes on to describe the role of failure and contradictory information in jaring the door to progress and new solutions. He describes how we are able to think beyond our usual thought processes when our ideas are challenged. Without conflict, our thinking will never change. We would have no reason to do anything in any different way then the ways that our minds are programmed to recognise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The creative process started with a problem, what you might even call a failure, in the existing technology. The vacuum cleaner kept blocking. It let out a screaming noise. Dyson had to keep bending down to pick up bits of rubbish by hand.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Had everything gone smoothly Dyson would have had no motivation to change things. Moreover, he would have had no intellectual challenge to sink his teeth into. It was the very nature of the engineering problem that sparked a possible solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>And this turns out to be the most perfect metaphor for the creative process, whether it involves vacuum cleaners, a quest for a new brand name or a new scientific theory. Creativity is, in many respects, a response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is that without recognising a failure, and without recognising that our present solution is far from optimal we have absolutely no reason to stray from our usual thinking and to activate our minds in search of a solution. We carry on doing things the same way because perhaps we don’t recognise the problem; perhaps we don’t deem it worthy of our attention; or perhaps we don’t recognise that a better solution is available. That is why we must as engineers begin to question the way we work, and allow conflict and contradiction to surround us. That is why we at Engineering Minds advocate the broadening of horizons. When you learn about different industries, you learn about solutions to problems and how they are overcome, and you begin to draw parallels, and the result is that your worldview expands. When your worldview expands, your understanding of problems and solutions changes entirely. You are no longer confined into one space.</p>

<h2 id="are-we-as-business-owners-actively-challenged-in-the-way-we-doing-things-enough">Are we as business owners, actively challenged in the way we doing things enough?</h2>

<p>Thinking beyond major innovations and examples of creativty, there are processes and solutions we use ever day that are far from optimal, but these are rarely challenged, and the result is a sort of plodding along, doing the same things in the same way without much insight or challenge as to the effectiveness of the eventual outcome. Sometimes the outcome itself isn’t necessary but we don’t realise it becuase it’s a process we’ve been carrying out for year.</p>

<p>Creativity doesn’t need to be a magnificent new solution to a problem. Creativity could be as simple as the merging of two processes into one more effective solution that saves times, and achieves a better outcome. That is after all, exactly the same creativity that Dyson was able to apply in his innovation, in 1978.</p>

<p>He was a connecting agent. The act of creativity was an act, above all, of synthesis. … In his moment of insight he essentially brought together two disparate ideas together: a vacuum and a sawmill. It turns out that this act of connectivity is another central feature of innovation.
Back to our businesses, so what can we do to reintroduce creativity into our work? (Each of these points will eventually warrant a blog post in themselves)</p>

<h2 id="expand-your-worldview">1. Expand your worldview.</h2>

<p>Your worldview is the way you see things and the bigger our worldview the more insight we are able to take from events. A wider worldview means we can recognise failures in one industry, by looking to another and understanding how they have overcome a very similar problem. We are able to merge ideas, and bring together two seemingly unrelated ideas and allow them to transpire into the solution we require.</p>

<h2 id="embrace-contradiction-failure-and-conflict">2. Embrace contradiction, failure and conflict.</h2>

<p>Failure is useful in two area essential to progress:</p>

<p>It is useful as an igniting spark for creativity.
Without these we have no reason to change and things will continue to progress as they have been. Do we really want that? Failure is the catalyst to change
It is useful in the execution phase that takes our creativity and turns it into an optimum solution. 
Back to Dyson on why we’re only 2 percent of the way there now:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is no good creating the most beautiful products if you produce them shoddily it is no good having the most innovative engineering solution if the customers can be certain it will be delivered on time. It is no good if inconsistent production means that a great idea is not translated into a finished product. The original idea is only 2 per cent of the journey. You mustn’t neglect the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dyson reveals the secrets behind his innovations and how discipline allowed him to continuously learn from failure and iterate on his designs hundreds of times until he was comfortable with a finished product.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dyson was not the first to come up with the idea of a cyclone vacuum cleaner. He was not even the second, or the third. But he was the only one with the stamina to ‘fail’ his concept into a workable solution. And he had the rigour to create an efficient manufacturing process, so he could sell a consistent product.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took dyson 5127 iterations to reach the optimal solution for his bagless vacuum cleaner. 5127! Embracing failure not only allows us to ignite the creative process, it allows us to reach optimum solutions to problems. More on the role of failure in reaching optimum solutions in, for now lets return to how we can be more creative.</p>

<h2 id="examine-your-ideas-often">3. Examine your Ideas Often.</h2>

<p>It’s important to understand from the Dyson story that creativity didn’t happen in a brainstorming session. Creativity occured becuase Dyson had the intuition to examine what was an everyday object, whilst refusing to accept that it was optimum.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>He embraced the problem. Most people would just accept that the hoover was rubbish and deal with all of it’s associated problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He had the worldview to find a solution. A hoover and a sawmill. He understood both seemingly unrelated objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He asked questions, he surrounded himself with contradictory information and information that would allow him to expand on the initial idea.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of an effective engineering culture then isn’t to facillitate change as a temporary process but as an integral part of the way work is done. Only by allowing people to examine and question the way things are done at all times, will we being to recognise problems and arrive at solutions. Discussion, contradiction and conflict in our work as engineers allow us to move forwards.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In his book Tribes, Seth Godin describes why those who should encourage non-sheep behaviour and the constant examining of the way things are done. The biggest step, though, comes from anyone who teaches or hires. And that’s to embrace non-sheep behavior, to reward it and cherish it. As we’ve seen just about everywhere there’s been growth lately, that’s where the good stuff happens
Understand and Seek Creativity in Your Everyday</p>

<p>So, for the next couple of weeks, think about James Dyson and the creative process. Take some time to think about the things that really irk you in your work (I guess a lot). Talk about them, talk to people that don’t do what you do, let them ask questions. You’d be surprised at how many issues you’ve just come to accept and some of the simple solutions that can begin to appear.</p>

<p>Here at bottom line, we don’t promise quick solutions but we do promise thoughtful and purposeful solutions which are tailored specifically to your needs. We allow ourselves the time to let things stew and improve upon them throughout the project, all within a fixed fee structure.</p>
